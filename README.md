<h1>Flashback app for Android</h1>
This project was basically a learning project for me in order to learn about developing for Android. Later it turned out that many people seemed to like what I had created and quite a few people downloaded the app, which obviously was a great confidence boost for me. At the moment (March 2015) there are about 9600 people with the app installed on one of their devices. I was happy when 20 people had it installed, and I never expected anything quite like this.

I am currently working on a new version of this app, where I will rewrite pretty much all of it. It's kind of slow at the moment since I have a lot of stuff going on right now but I do stuff when I can :)

The app can be found at https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.dev.flashback_v04

Apologies for lack of comments pretty much everywhere. Also for a lot of stuff that should have been cleaned up and removed, but is still there.
